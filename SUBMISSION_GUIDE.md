# Submission Guide - Byte-builders_sentinel

## Team Information
- **Team Name**: Byte-builders  
- **Team Number**: [Fill in your assigned team number]
- **Project**: PROJECT SENTINEL - Retail Analytics & Optimization Platform
- **Challenge Focus**: Comprehensive retail intelligence system addressing inventory shrinkage, self-checkout security, resource allocation, and customer experience

## Solution Overview

**Comprehensive Retail Intelligence Platform** that addresses all 4 core retail challenges:

Our system implements a sophisticated multi-algorithm approach to modern retail challenges, providing real-time analytics for loss prevention, operational efficiency, and customer experience optimization. The platform integrates 7 specialized algorithms processing multiple data streams (RFID, POS, queue monitoring, inventory, product recognition) to deliver actionable insights through an interactive dashboard.

**Key Innovation**: Cross-stream correlation analysis enabling detection of complex fraud patterns like scan avoidance and barcode switching that single-source systems miss.

## Algorithm Implementation

**7 Core Retail Analytics Algorithms** (all properly tagged with `# @algorithm Name | Purpose`):

1. **Scan Avoidance Detection** - Identifies potential scan avoidance incidents by correlating RFID and POS data
2. **Barcode Switching Detection** - Identifies barcode switching fraud through price-catalog validation  
3. **Weight Discrepancy Detection** - Identifies weight-based theft attempts via expected vs actual weight analysis
4. **System Crash Detection** - Identifies system malfunctions and crashes for proactive maintenance
5. **Queue Length Analysis** - Analyzes and alerts on long queue situations for customer experience optimization
6. **Inventory Discrepancy Detection** - Identifies inventory shrinkage issues through systematic stock analysis
7. **Staffing Optimization** - Recommends optimal staffing based on real-time traffic patterns

**Supporting Algorithms**: Event Processing, Retail Metrics Calculation, Station Performance Visualization, Anomaly Heatmap Generation

## Dashboard Features

**Professional Real-time Intelligence Interface** (http://127.0.0.1:5000):

- **Live Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time KPIs including total events, anomaly rates, critical alerts, system error rates
- **Station Performance Monitoring**: Individual performance tracking for SCC1-SCC4 + RC1 with anomaly rate visualization  
- **Interactive Anomaly Heatmaps**: Time-based pattern visualization showing when/where incidents occur
- **Real-time Inventory Management**: Current stock levels with discrepancy highlighting
- **Staffing Recommendations**: Dynamic resource allocation suggestions based on traffic analysis
- **Auto-refresh Technology**: 30-second updates ensuring real-time operational intelligence
- **Responsive Design**: Professional interface optimized for operational environments
